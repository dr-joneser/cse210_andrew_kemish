Program File is the main file, calling all the methods and trying to make everything work. I haven't been able to figure out how to use objects and connect everything 
the way that I want it to run. But the methods and functions are all there to make the program work, I just don't know what to do now. Card1 file I made to generate a
random number from 1-13 and to store that as the current card value. There is also a method in there to make the new card replace the current card value for the next 
round. The Input file displays messages to the user and collects the input if they guess high or low, and if they would like to keep playing or not. And the Score file
has a method to compare if the user's guess was correct, and then it assigns the correct number of points to the score.
